Write a program which implements the A* algorithm on an arbitrary map described through “connections” file and “locations” file. The “locations” file includes the names of the locations and their x and y positions. The “connections” file includes how the locations are connected.  The algorithm should allow the user to exclude 1 or more cities from the solution path. 

Two A* algorithm heuristics, “Straight Line Distance” and “Fewest Cities" should be implemented and the user should select which one should be used for a given run. Note: The “Fewest Cities” is the path in which the fewest number of cities are included in the solution path. 

To execute this code:
-Navigate to the directory where the files are held via command line.
-Identify the file 'aStar.py'. Also ensure that 'filehandler.py', 'helpers.py' and the the text documents are there as well.
-Assuming Python has been installed already, enter command 'py aStar.py'
